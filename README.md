NEXTJS TODO APP WITH NODEJS BACKEND API

Project URL:


Description: 
-- This Todo-App is built using Nextjs for the front-end and Nodejs as backend.
-- The app needs a visited user to create a login ID to be able to perform CRUD operations.
-- The app will then only load the particular logged user data.

Notes: 
-- The project is only built as a learning project and should not be used in production without proper configuration!
-- The app uses user credentials for further functionality so please be careful and do not provide sensitive data.
-- The app may face delay due to backend hosted on free tier as of now.
